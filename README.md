SwiftTutorial
=============

This is my Swift Programming Language Reference. It started out originally in Jul-2014 when I taught 
a Swift Programming Language class at Amazon. And I've been updatng it ever since to stay current
with the latest developments in the Swift programming language.

Structure
---------
I've created unit tests that exercise various aspects of Swift. They are not meant to be testing the 
compiler though. They just act as code snippets that show how to use various aspects of the Swift
language. Why not use Playgrounds? Because the Swift Repl doesn't always behave in the same manner as  
the Swift compiler. There is no point wasting time finding wrokarounds for Repl bugs when I could
simply code the right thing in the unit tests. 

The unit test classes have a numerical suffix like 007 to indicate their "chapter number". Start from 
000 and keep going incrementally to the highest numbered chapter. Care has been taken to ensure that
all the pre-requisites for chapter N are covered in chapters 0 to N-1. So I'd recommend going through 
these in order if this is your first time learning Swift. 

The non-suffix portion of the test classes is a description of roughly the language concept being
studied in that test class.

Within each test class, attempt has been made to order the tests in terms of complexity or pre-requsites.

Hope you enjoy the tutorials and feel free to send me pull requests in case you want to recommend any changes.
